## Example

If you start doing Jhatka and eating meat of animals, what is stopping you eating humans?


## Understanding the Slippery Slope Fallacy

A slippery slope fallacy occurs when someone argues that a specific action will lead to a series of negative events without any logical connection or evidence to prove that these events will actually occur.

* **Characteristics**:
  * **Unjustified Sequence**: The argument presents a chain of events where the initial action is connected to the final outcome without justification.
  * **Lack of Evidence**: There is no empirical or logical evidence provided to support the inevitability of the progression.
  * **Exaggeration**: The consequences are often extreme and unlikely, used to instill fear or dissuade from the initial action.

## Applying It To The Example

1. **Initial Action**: Eating meat from animals slaughtered through Jhatka, a method practiced in Sikhism where the animal is killed with a single stroke to minimize suffering.
2. **Assumed Progression**: The argument implies that consuming animal meat will remove moral barriers, leading one to eventually consume human flesh.
3. **Flawed Reasoning**:
    * **Moral Distinctions Ignored**: The argument overlooks the significant moral, legal, and ethical differences society places between animals and humans.
    * **Lack of Causation**: There is no logical causation that eating animal meat will lead someone to eat human meat.
    * **Social and Legal Barriers**: It ignores the strong social taboos and legal prohibitions against cannibalism that prevent such behavior, regardless of dietary choices involving animals.

## Why It's a Fallacy

* **Exaggerated Outcome**: Jumping from eating animal meat to eating humans is an extreme leap that exaggerates the potential consequences.
* **Fear Appeal**: The argument attempts to dissuade the initial action by invoking fear of a highly undesirable outcome.
* **Absence of Evidence**: There is no evidence or logical framework provided to support the claim that one action will lead to the other.

## Conclusion

The statement commits a slippery slope fallacy by suggesting that starting to eat meat through Jhatka will inevitably lead to cannibalism, without any logical basis or evidence for this progression. It exaggerates the consequences of the initial action to an unrealistic and extreme outcome, thus employing faulty reasoning to make its point.
