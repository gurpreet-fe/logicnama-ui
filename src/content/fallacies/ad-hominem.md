## Scenario

After Baaj Singh gives a speech on why the Khalsa is open to all castes and backgrounds, a member of the audience stands up and says “why should I listen to a Jatt Sikh?”

## Understanding the Ad Hominem Fallacy

An ad hominem fallacy occurs when someone attacks the character, motive, or other attribute of the person making an argument rather than addressing the substance of the argument itself. This shifts the focus from the argument to the individual, undermining the logical discussion.

* **Types of Ad Hominem**:
    * **Abusive Ad Hominem**: Directly insulting or verbally abusing the person.
    * **Circumstantial Ad Hominem**: Suggesting that the person's circumstances or background invalidate their argument.
    * **Tu Quoque ("You Too")**: Accusing the person of hypocrisy instead of addressing their point.

## Applying It To The Example

1. **The Original Argument**:
    * **Speaker's Point**: The Singh argues that the Khalsa, the collective body of initiated Sikhs, is open to all individuals regardless of caste or background, aligning with Sikhism's teachings of equality and rejection of the caste system.
2. **Audience Member's Response**:
    * **Question**: "Why should I listen to a Mazhbi Sikh?"
    * **Implication**: The audience member dismisses the speaker's argument solely based on the speaker's caste background (Mazhbi Sikh), which refers to a community historically marginalized in the caste hierarchy.
3. **Why This Is an Ad Hominem Fallacy**:
    * **Attack on Personal Background**: Instead of engaging with the argument about inclusivity, the audience member targets the speaker's caste.
    * **Irrelevant to Argument's Merit**: The speaker's caste does not logically affect the validity of the argument that the Khalsa is open to all.
    * **Avoidance of Logical Debate**: By focusing on the speaker's identity, the audience member sidesteps any meaningful discussion of the actual points raised.

## Why It's Fallacious Reasoning

* **Deflection from the Argument**: The audience member does not address any specific points made about the Khalsa's inclusivity.
* **Prejudice Over Logic**: The dismissal is rooted in caste-based bias, which undermines rational evaluation.
* **Contradicts Sikh Principles**: Sikhism emphasizes equality and rejects caste discrimination; using caste to invalidate an argument is antithetical to these teachings.

## Conclusion

The audience member commits an ad hominem fallacy by rejecting the speaker's argument based on his caste background rather than the content of his message. This logical fallacy detracts from productive discourse and perpetuates discrimination, which is contrary to the fundamental Sikh values of equality and justice.
