title: 'Composition/Divison'
description: 'You assumed that one part of something has to be applied to all, or other, parts of it; or that the whole must apply to its parts.'

## Example

Someone argues, “Because Guru Nanak was born in a Hindu family, it must mean that Sikhs are Hindus.”


## Understanding the Composition/Division Fallacy

The Composition/Division Fallacy occurs when someone assumes that what is true for a part must be true for the whole (composition) or, conversely, that what is true for the whole must be true for all its parts (division). In other words, it mistakenly transfers attributes between parts and wholes without sufficient justification.

* **Characteristics**:
  * **Part-to-Whole Error (Composition)**: Assuming that since a part of something has a certain property, the entire group or system must also have that property.
  * **Whole-to-Part Error (Division)**: Assuming that since the whole group or system has a certain property, all individual parts must also have that property.
  * **False Generalization**: Applying attributes incorrectly between individuals and groups, or between parts and wholes.



## Applying It To The Example

1. **Initial Argument**:
    * **Guru Nanak’s Family Background**: The claim begins by stating that Guru Nanak was born into a Hindu family, which is a fact about his individual background.
    * **Assumption**: From this fact, the argument then jumps to the assumption that Sikhs must be Hindus because of Guru Nanak’s birth into a Hindu family.
2. **Why This Is a Composition/Division Fallacy**:
    * **Part-to-Whole Fallacy (Composition)**: The argument assumes that because Guru Nanak was born in a Hindu family (a part of his background), the entire Sikh religion must be an extension of Hinduism, which is a false composition. Guru Nanak’s teachings and the founding of Sikhi introduced a distinct religious philosophy that cannot be reduced to his family of origin.
    * **Ignoring Context and Individuality**: This argument ignores the historical and theological distinctions Guru Nanak made in his teachings, which emphasized a unique spiritual path that eventually became Sikhism, distinct from both Hinduism and Islam.

3. **Mistaken Generalization Instead of Understanding**:
    * **From Part to Whole**: The fallacy here lies in wrongly concluding that the entire Sikh community must share the same religious identity (Hindu) as Guru Nanak’s family, without considering the actual formation of Sikhism as a separate faith with its own practices and beliefs.


## Why It's Fallacious Reasoning

* **Misapplication of Attributes**: The argument assumes that because Guru Nanak’s personal background included being born into a Hindu family, the entire religion of Sikhism must be Hindu as well. This overlooks the distinct identity that Sikhism developed under Guru Nanak’s guidance, with its own teachings, values, and practices.
* **Overgeneralization**: The fallacy occurs because it takes one fact (Guru Nanak’s family background) and overgeneralizes it to the entire Sikh faith, ignoring the theological and historical evolution of Sikhism as a separate religion.
* **Failure to Engage with Core Teachings**: The argument dismisses the unique contributions of Guru Nanak’s teachings, which were meant to transcend existing religious frameworks, including both Hinduism and Islam.



## Conclusion

The claim that “because Guru Nanak was born in a Hindu family, Sikhs must be Hindus” exemplifies the Composition/Division Fallacy. It wrongly assumes that because one part of Guru Nanak’s life (his family background) is Hindu, the entire religion of Sikhism must also be Hindu. This fallacy overlooks the formation of Sikhism as a distinct faith with its own set of beliefs and practices, stemming from Guru Nanak’s teachings, which were independent of his family’s religion. This kind of reasoning undermines the recognition of Sikhism’s unique identity and philosophical foundations.
