title: 'Loaded Question'
description: "You asked a question that had a presumption built into it so that it couldn't be answered without appearing guilty."

## Example

A Sikh asks another Sikh why they believe they are above their Sant Baba for questioning or doubting something they said.


## Understanding the Loaded Question Fallacy

A Loaded Question Fallacy occurs when someone asks a question that contains a controversial or unjustified assumption, making it difficult to answer without appearing guilty or accepting that assumption. It's a way to trap the respondent into admitting something they might disagree with.

 * **Characteristics**:
   * **Unwarranted Assumptions**: The question embeds assumptions that may not be accepted by the person being asked.
   * **No Good Answer**: Any direct response can make the respondent seem as if they accept the underlying assumptions.
   * **Manipulative**: It puts the respondent in a defensive position, diverting from rational debate.


## Applying It To The Example

1. **The Question Asked**:
   * "Why do you believe you are above your Sant Baba for questioning or doubting something they said?"
2. **Embedded Assumptions**:
   * **Assumption 1**: The person believes they are superior to the Sant Baba.
   * **Assumption 2**: The Sant Baba is universally accepted by all Sikhs.
   * **Assumption 3**: The Sant Baba is infallible, and whatever they say is factually correct.
   * **Assumption 4**: Questioning or doubting the Sant Baba is inappropriate or disrespectful.
3. **Why This Is a Loaded Question**:
   * **Traps the Respondent**: If they deny believing they're above the Sant Baba, they might seem to accept that questioning is wrong. If they justify their questioning, they might seem arrogant.
   * **Presupposes Agreement**: It assumes that the respondent accepts the Sant Baba's authority and infallibility.
   * **Shifts Focus**: The question diverts attention from the validity of the Sant Baba's statement to the respondent's perceived attitude.



## Why It's Fallacious Reasoning

 * **Suppresses Critical Thinking**:
   * **Sikhi Encourages Inquiry**: Sikh teachings promote understanding through reflection and questioning. The Gurus themselves engaged in many dialogues to elucidate spiritual concepts (Sikhan Di Bhagat Mala written by Shaheed Bhai Mani Singh is a good example).
   * **Human Fallibility**: Human interpretations can be fallible. Questioning helps in seeking truth, it iterates the process of replacing bad ideas with better ideas when one engages with Sangat to understand multiple perspectives.
 * **Invalid Assumptions**:
   * **Not Universally Accepted Authority**: Not all Sikhs may recognize the individual as a Sant Baba or agree on their authority.
   * **Definition of Sant Baba**: The term typically refers to someone devoted to spiritual practice (Naam Simran), not someone beyond question necessarily. A real Sant Baba can provide a valuable perspective or opinion, but it should not act as a middleman for your own personal and unique relationship with the Guru - which is individualistic and catered to every Sikh. A good Sant may be guidance, not gospel. A Sikh becomes a Sikh to follow the Guru, not others. These others can be an aid or detriment to that relationship, but it is down to the Sikh to discern the difference and not just blindly accept on the basis of labels alone.
   * **Right to Question**: Questioning does not imply feeling superior; it can stem from a desire to understand better.
 * **Creates a False Dilemma**:
   * **Either Accept or Be Arrogant**: The question implies that one must either accept the Sant Baba's words unquestioningly or be arrogantly placing oneself above them, ignoring other valid reasons for questioning.



## Conclusion

The question is a Loaded Question Fallacy because it contains several unjustified assumptions that force the respondent into a corner. It assumes that questioning the Sant Baba is equivalent to claiming superiority, which isn't necessarily true. This fallacy hinders open dialogue and critical examination, which are important aspects of personal growth and understanding in Sikhi.
