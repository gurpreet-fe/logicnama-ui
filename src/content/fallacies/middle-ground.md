title: 'Middle Ground'
description: "You claimed that a compromise, or middle point, between two extremes must be the truth"

## Example

A debate arises in the Sangat about whether to continue the traditional practice of reading Guru Granth Sahib Ji in Gurmukhi or to replace it with a complete English translation for younger generations. One group argues that preserving Gurmukhi is essential to maintaining the integrity of the teachings, while another group believes translating everything into English will make it more accessible to younger members. A third group suggests a compromise: translating half of the Guru Granth Sahib Ji into English while keeping the other half in Gurmukhi, claiming this middle ground as the best solution.


## Understanding the Middle Ground Fallacy

* **Definition**:The Middle Ground Fallacy occurs when someone assumes that the middle point between two opposing arguments must be the correct or best solution simply because it represents a compromise. However, the mere existence of two sides does not mean the truth lies halfway between them, especially if one argument is clearly stronger or more supported by evidence.
* **Characteristics**:
  * **False Compromise**:Assuming that a position between two extremes must be the correct one, without considering whether the compromise makes sense or addresses the core concerns.
  * **Arbitrary Middle Point**:The middle ground is chosen not because it is logically sound, but simply because it seems to be a balance between opposing views.
  * **Ignoring Merit of Arguments**:This fallacy overlooks the actual strength, evidence, or reasoning behind each side and assumes that both must be equally valid to some degree.

## Applying It To The Example

1. **Initial Arguments**:
  * **Preserving Gurmukhi**:One group argues that Guru Granth Sahib Ji must continue to be read in Gurmukhi, as it preserves the original language, poetic structure, and spiritual significance of the text, which would be lost in translation.
  * **Complete Translation for Accessibility**:The opposing group believes translating the entire Guru Granth Sahib Ji into English is necessary to make the teachings more accessible to younger Sikhs who may not understand Gurmukhi, thus enabling them to connect more deeply with Sikhi.
2. **The Middle Ground Position**:
  * **Half in Gurmukhi, Half in English**:A third group suggests that the solution must be somewhere in between**:translating half of the Guru Granth Sahib Ji into English while keeping the other half in Gurmukhi. They claim this compromise is the best way to satisfy both sides.
3. **Why This Is the Middle Ground Fallacy**:
  * **Arbitrary Compromise**:The idea of translating only half the Guru Granth Sahib Ji is an arbitrary compromise. It doesn’t address the deeper concerns on either side — it doesn’t fully preserve the spiritual integrity of the text as argued by the first group, nor does it make the teachings fully accessible, as desired by the second group.
  * **False Balance**:Just because there are two opposing views doesn’t mean the best solution lies in the middle. The compromise of translating only half the scripture doesn’t logically resolve the core issues raised by either group, making it an illogical middle ground.
  * **Avoiding the Substance of the Debate**:The middle-ground suggestion avoids the deeper debate about whether the text should remain fully in Gurmukhi for spiritual and historical reasons or be fully translated for accessibility. It assumes that balancing both sides equally is the best approach without engaging with the merits of each position.

## Why It's Fallacious Reasoning

* **Compromise Isn't Always Correct**:While finding balance can sometimes be useful, it isn’t always logical or practical. The suggestion of translating half the Guru Granth Sahib Ji doesn’t resolve the actual issues raised by either side, making it an arbitrary solution.
* **Overlooking the Merits of Each Argument**:The middle ground fallacy assumes both sides are equally valid, without considering whether one side might have stronger reasoning or evidence. In this case, the suggestion ignores the importance of fully preserving the original Gurmukhi script or making the teachings completely accessible through translation.
* **Ineffective Solution**:The proposed middle ground (half translation) doesn’t truly meet the needs of either group. It neither preserves the full integrity of the text in Gurmukhi, nor does it make the teachings fully accessible to those who don’t understand Gurmukhi.

## Conclusion

The suggestion to translate only half of Guru Granth Sahib Ji into English while keeping the other half in Gurmukhi exemplifies the Middle Ground Fallacy. It assumes that a compromise between the two positions must be the best solution, without considering the deeper reasons and consequences behind each argument. This arbitrary compromise does not effectively address the concerns about preserving the integrity of Sikh scripture or making it fully accessible, illustrating that simply finding the middle point between two opposing arguments is not always the correct approach.
