## Example

A member of the Sangat approaches a Gurdwara committee, criticizing them for misusing donations to renovate their personal residence instead of using them for community projects or charitable work as promised. Instead of addressing the concern about the misuse of donations, the committee responds by accusing the member of the Sangat of not donating enough to the Gurdwara and just coming to eat the Langar only.


## Understanding the Tu Quoque Fallacy

* **Definition**: The Tu Quoque Fallacy, also known as the appeal to hypocrisy, occurs when someone tries to deflect criticism by turning it back on the accuser instead of addressing the original issue. It shifts the focus away from the accusation and onto the person making it, avoiding direct engagement with the critique at hand.
* **Characteristics**:
  * **Deflection**: Instead of engaging with the substance of the criticism, the accused person shifts the attention to the actions or behavior of the accuser.
  * **Avoidance of Responsibility**: By pointing out a perceived fault in the accuser, the person committing the fallacy sidesteps their own accountability.
  * **Irrelevant Response**: The counter-criticism is irrelevant to the original concern, serving as a distraction rather than a valid argument.


## Applying It To The Example

1. **Initial Criticism**:
    * **Misuse of Donations**: A member of the Sangat criticizes the Gurdwara committee for using donated funds for personal renovations rather than for community projects or charitable purposes as originally intended.
    * **Serious Concern**: The critique questions the ethical use of community funds, which is an issue of accountability and transparency.
2. **Response from the Committee**:
    * **Counter-Criticism**: Instead of addressing the issue about the misuse of funds, the committee accuses the member of not contributing enough and of merely coming to enjoy the free Langar (food service).
3. **Why This Is Tu Quoque**:
    * **Shifting Focus**: The committee avoids engaging with the criticism of how they handled the donations and instead focuses on the behavior of the person making the accusation, deflecting the conversation away from the issue of financial misuse.
    * **Irrelevant Accusation**: Whether the member of the Sangat donated enough or partook in Langar has no bearing on the validity of the original claim about misusing donations.
4. **Deflection Instead of Accountability**:
    * **Avoiding Responsibility**: The committee uses a personal attack against the critic to sidestep the need to answer the ethical question raised about their management of donations.

## Why It's Fallacious Reasoning

* **Failure to Engage**: The committee avoids addressing the core issue (misuse of funds) by attacking the critic personally, which derails the conversation and prevents a meaningful discussion about the actual concern.
* **Distraction Tactic**: By turning the conversation to the Sangat member’s personal actions, the committee deflects attention away from their own actions, avoiding accountability.
* **Irrelevant Argument**: The accusation that the Sangat member doesn’t donate enough is irrelevant to the question of how the Gurdwara funds are being used, making the response logically flawed.


## Conclusion

The Gurdwara committee’s response to the criticism about misusing donations exemplifies the Tu Quoque Fallacy. Instead of addressing the legitimate concerns raised by the Sangat member, they deflect the criticism by attacking the individual’s behavior. This logical fallacy undermines productive discussion by shifting focus away from the core issue and failing to engage with the substance of the criticism.
